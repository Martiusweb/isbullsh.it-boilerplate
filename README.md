# isBullsh.it boilerplate

A blog powered by jekyll that we're building.

## Authors

Current contributors are :

 - Paul Adenot
 - Martin Richard
 - Balthazar Rouberol

## TODO

 - On the home page, add a sidebar like in the post page with blog informations
   (like RSS feed link, etc).
 - Add pagination to the archive pages.
 - Add css/js minifier operations during build.

## Good practices

 - Tag names (in article files) must be in lower-case
