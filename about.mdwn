# Hey, why do you troll the techs you're talking about?

You are talking about the name of the blog? isBullsh.it? We were brainstorming
avout a blog name when we discovered that this domain name was available. It
sounded cool, we kept it.

We don't want to be rude or insult the work of anyone, at least, not in the name
of the blog (I can't say that for the content).

# Autors

This amazing website contains cool blog posts about tech and non-tech stuff.

Here we can write stuff about us.
