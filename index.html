    <h1>H1, Hold on to your butts</h1>
    <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This
    gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe
    that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the
    most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that
    shit.</p>
    <h2>H2, Is she dead, yes or no?</h2>
    <p>Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all
    makes sense! In a comic, you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's
    going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most times they're
    friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why,
    David? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.</p>
    <h3>H3, We happy?</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called
    a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the
    strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
    Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become
    nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>

    <hr>
    <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of
    the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of
    charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
    for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I
    will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who
    would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name
    is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>
    <h4>H4, I gotta piss</h4>
    <p>Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it
    right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a glass motherfuckin' house,
    fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he
    better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm
    sayin'?</p>
